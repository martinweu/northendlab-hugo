I am a computer scientist with an interest in machine learning and data science. Currently, I am working at Catalysts doing Data Science Projects in Industry and Retail. Another part of my daily work is developing digital agendas for all sorts of industries. Besides that, I am in the final steps of my master's in Computer Science. Through my mostly academic but also corporate work I identified my passion and abilities in leadership.
