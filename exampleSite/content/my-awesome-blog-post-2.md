I use Shelly 2.5 to control my shades which are controlled via some proprietary controller. To overcome this barrier I use Shelly 2.5 to simulate the press of the actual control switches. Therefore, the Shelly needs to switch the 12V signal. The Shelly 2.5 needs the same voltage for operation as it is switching. The Shelly 1 allows running with a different voltage.
